# FlightSimulator

A physics-based flight simulation in pure C. Uses NACA airfoil data to emulate the flight characteristics of a Cessna 172 with realistic air density/pressure, lift/drag forces, and 6 control surfaces. Supports both keyboard and controller input and can display all forces acting on the aircraft in real-time.
